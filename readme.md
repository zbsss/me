## Info
Based on [nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit), it uses Notion as a CMS, fetching content from Notion and then uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x) to render everything.

After pushing to `master` a Travis job (defined in `.travis-yaml`) exports the project to static HTML and publishes the result to Github Pages.

## Development
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
